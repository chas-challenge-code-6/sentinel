# **Project Sentinel – Smart Workplace Sensor for High-Risk Professions**

## **Introduction**
In a world where occupational hazards remain a significant problem for many professions, innovative solutions are needed to ensure safer working conditions. Project Sentinel combines smart workplace sensors with advanced data analysis to identify and prevent potential dangers in real time. By integrating smart monitoring and alert systems, we can reduce workplace accidents and improve safety in high-risk professions.

## **Challenge**
Many professions, such as construction workers, firefighters, factory workers, and healthcare personnel, face daily occupational risks that can lead to severe injuries or life-threatening incidents. Exposure to hazardous gases, extreme noise levels, temperature fluctuations, and fall accidents can escalate quickly if risks are not detected in time.

Current safety practices are often reactive—measures are taken only after an accident has occurred. Project Sentinel shifts the focus to a proactive and data-driven safety solution that can identify and address risks before they result in incidents.

## **Solution – Smart Workplace Sensor**
Project Sentinel provides a wearable workplace sensor connected to a platform for advanced data analysis and real-time monitoring. The solution is designed to detect environmental anomalies and alert both the user and the employer to potential hazards.

### **Core Features**
✅ **Real-time Analysis** – Sensors continuously collect and analyze environmental data.  
✅ **Automatic Alerts** – Instant notifications are sent in hazardous situations.  
✅ **Smart Risk Detection** – The system analyzes historical data and identifies potential risk patterns.  
✅ **Integration with Safety Systems** – Compatible with existing workplace safety systems.  
✅ **User-Friendly Mobile App** – A clear and intuitive interface for monitoring and reporting.

## **Technology – Smart Sensors and Data Analysis**
To create a comprehensive safety solution, Project Sentinel integrates multiple advanced sensors and analysis tools:

### **Sensor Hardware**
🔍 **Gas Sensor** – Detects hazardous gases such as carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia.  
🌡 **Temperature & Humidity Sensor** – Identifies heat stress and hypothermia risks.  
📉 **Accelerometer & Gyroscope** – Detects sudden falls and abnormal movements.  
❤️ **Pulse & Oxygen Sensor** – Monitors fatigue and oxygen deficiency.  
📡 **LTE/LoRa Communication** – Ensures a stable connection even in areas without reliable Wi-Fi.

### **Data Analysis and Monitoring**
📊 **Data-Driven Safety** – The system analyzes historical data to identify dangerous trends.  
🔔 **Automatic Alarms** – Immediate alerts are triggered when hazardous conditions are detected.  
🔗 **Workplace System Integration** – Seamless connectivity with existing safety systems.

## **System Architecture**
Project Sentinel is built on a robust frontend and backend that work seamlessly together to manage data, analyze risks, and present real-time information to users.

### **Frontend System**
📱 **User-Friendly Interface:**
- Real-time display of workplace environmental data.
- Notifications and alerts for detected risks.
