# Our Retrospective from this project

## First impressions
Our first impressions of the Chas Challenge project was mixed. Some of us were exited and some scared or nervous of different reasons. Although we had different impressions we all felt this would be incredibly instructive. Our collective feeling was anyway positive!

## In progress

## Further development
Because our clock unfortunately got stuck in boot mode and we didn't have the time to fix it we had to rethink our plans for collecting data for the Heart rate, pedometer etc. Although if we had more time we would reset the clock and try again. 

We want to add the possibility to send data to nearby coworkers or pedestrians if any accidents or incident occur, again the time constraints made us rethink the idea. This is again something that had been amazing to have in our presentation but had to be removed from the finished product.
