# Project Sentinel â€“ Smart Workplace Sensor for High-Risk Professions

## 1. Introduction and Background

### Purpose and Goals

Project Sentinel aims to create an intelligent and proactive safety solution for high-risk workplaces. By utilizing advanced IoT sensors and data analysis, the system will identify and alert users to potential hazards in the work environment in real-time. This reduces the number of accidents and creates a safer work environment.

### Problem Description

Many professions are exposed daily to risks such as hazardous gases, noise, temperature fluctuations, and falls. Current safety measures are often reactive rather than proactive. Project Sentinel addresses this by:

- Detecting workplace hazards in real-time.
- Automatically alerting users and managers to potential threats.
- Analyzing historical data to identify risk patterns and prevent future accidents.

### Target Audience

- Construction and infrastructure sectors
- Industrial and manufacturing sectors
- Firefighters and emergency responders
- Healthcare and emergency medical personnel
- Transportation and logistics sectors

## 2. Technology Selection and Architecture
