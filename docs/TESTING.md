### TESTING for hardware

In our project for the hardware we've created seperate enviorments in platformio in order to test separate parts of our code. In the process of testing the code we've used a simulation using wokwi for those how didn't have the direct hardware. 

We've tried to test the smartwatch into sending data (at most steps and heartrate) but after some time and after a few tweeks the watch got stuck in boot mode. In order to fix the issue we bought a heart rate pulse band, and installed a accelerometer onto the PCB board.

Ofcourse we've tried the different parts all together but beyond this most of the tests have been successful therefore not a lot av testing has been made. We haven't gotten any time for implementing test functions/test cases for our project, as we've been focuing on making the project work and used our time for other tasks from the school.
