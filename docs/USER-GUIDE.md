## Data transfer
The Sentinel will continuously collect the data, some more often then the other, and will at regular intervals send the data to our Backend and database.
The Backend handles the data in a secure manner and puts the data in each respective area for each colleague. Each user will have their own part of this database and the API is connected to each user in order to send the correct data to each user.

## Application
This data will then be able to be shown in the Frontend application. The application will first of present you with a log in page, thereafter an overview of your current data. You'll be able to enter your personal information in the user tab, look at the news tab in order to check in with your colleagues and even switch between Light and Dark mode.
